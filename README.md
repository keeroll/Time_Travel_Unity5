# Time Travel game in Unity5

###Project for university course
Here we have a little scene, where we can travel back in time.

I use serializefield in units for recording data, which are stored in the dictionary.

The game have 4 portal, every two create one.
At the exit of the last portal, recording ends and begins playing action.

The game has a function of two-way reverse (rewind), which works with a copy. 

Forward - R and Back - Q.

In the case of a bug work-up is set manually start recording playback function. 

Button - P.
